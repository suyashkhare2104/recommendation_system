# Recommendation System

A machine learning-based recommendation system that provides personalized suggestions to users.

## Overview

This project implements a recommendation system using [mention algorithms/techniques you're using, e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, etc.]. It's designed to analyze user preferences and behavior to deliver tailored recommendations.

## Features

- User preference analysis
- Item similarity computation
- Personalized recommendation generation
- [Add other key features of your system]

## Technologies Used

- Python
- [List libraries: e.g., Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.]
- [Any databases or other technologies]

Step-by-Step Instructions to Run the News Recommendation System
1. Clone the Repository (if you haven't already)
Bash
`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-recommendation-system.git`
`cd news-recommendation-system`

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment
Bash
- For macOS/Linux
` python -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`

- For Windows
`python -m venv venv`
`venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Dependencies
Bash
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

4. Prepare the Data Directory
Bash
`mkdir -p data`
`mkdir -p data/processed`

5. Add Your News Dataset
Place your news dataset (CSV format) in the data directory. The CSV should have at least:
title column
published_date column
topic column (optional)

6. Process and Vectorize the Data
Bash
`python vectorize.py`

This will create vector embeddings and save them to the data/processed directory.
7. Run the Streamlit Application
Bash
`python app.py`
8. Access the Application
Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost:8501

9. Using the Application
Enter search queries to find relevant news articles
Browse articles by topic if available
Click on articles to see more details
Find similar articles based on content similarity

Troubleshooting
If you encounter memory issues with large datasets, edit vectorize.py to reduce the sample_size parameter
Make sure your CSV file has the correct format and required columns
Check that all dependencies are properly installed
